# WEETOO — Live Trading Broadcasting Platform Landing Page

## Vision
A dark, immersive, energy-filled landing page that feels like **Twitch for traders** — not a corporate fintech site. Users should immediately feel that real trading is happening live, right now.

---

## Page Structure (Top to Bottom)

### 1. Sticky Market Pulse Bar
- Fixed dark bar at the top (~60-70px) with real-time-style animated data
- **Total Payback** (animated counting number), **Liquidation data**, **Long vs Short ratio** (progress bar), **Fear & Greed** mini gauge
- Numbers update with subtle glow effects (green for positive, red for negative)
- Bloomberg Terminal aesthetic

### 2. Compact Hero Headline
- Bold, minimal headline: **"WE ARE TRADERS."** or **"Trade Together. Live."**
- Subtle glow/gradient text effect — no paragraph explanations
- Two CTA buttons with neon border styling:
  - **"Enter Live Floor"** (primary)
  - **"Start Broadcasting"** (secondary)
- Takes minimal vertical space — NOT a traditional hero banner

### 3. LIVE Trading Room Grid (The True Hero)
- **Desktop:** 4-column grid, 2 rows visible above fold (8 rooms)
- **Tablet:** 3 columns
- **Mobile:** 2 columns, at least 4 visible without scrolling

**Each Trading Room Card includes:**
- Chart thumbnail (styled like real trading charts)
- Trader name & avatar
- Viewer count with eye icon
- Live duration (e.g., "2h 15m")
- Asset tag (BTC, ETH, etc.)
- **Animated LIVE badge** — red pill shape with blinking dot and pulse animation

**Card Interactions:**
- Hover: slight scale-up (1.02-1.04) with soft glow/shadow
- Subtle shimmer effect on chart thumbnail

---

## Design Language
- **Theme:** Dark immersive (deep black/dark navy base)
- **Accent colors:** Neon green (profit), Red (live/loss), Gold (brand premium)
- **Typography:** Large, bold, minimal — no walls of text
- **Energy:** Dense but structured, like a broadcasting platform

## Motion & Animation
- LIVE badge pulse animation (CSS-based, performant)
- Animated counters in the market bar
- Subtle hover lift on cards
- Light scroll-based reveal animations
- No heavy animations that impact performance

## Mobile Experience
- Feels like a live content app (TikTok Live / YouTube Live grid)
- Compact sticky data bar
- Grid-first layout, no big headers
- Larger LIVE badges, thumb-friendly card sizing
